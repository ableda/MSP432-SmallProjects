# MSP432-SmallProjects
Microprocessor projects in C

This repository includes 3 small MSP432 source files. These were developed through a microprocessors course at BU and serve as a good basis to get started with microcontroller development.

1) Music

The music source file allows to play any song you know the notes and tempo to through the buzzer. This is useful for setting up ringtones or other music related feedback.

2) Board to Board Communication

This small project can be used to set up board to board games using the educational BoosterPack MKII LCD screen. It serves as a good introduction to UART and LCD screen coding. 

3) Home Intrusion System

This project showcases how a useful small project can be done with as simple microcontroller and 200 lines of code. We used a GSM module and a PIR sensor to build a system that would detect motion and send an alert text to the user. The user can also send reset commands to the GSM module to rearm the system. The following picture is a diagram of the system:
